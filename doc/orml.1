.SH INSTALLING
.PP
Make is used for installing and removing orml.
The commands build & clean can be used for this, build being the
default.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ git\ clone\ https://github.com/muse/orml
$\ make\ build
\f[]
.fi
.PP
After that, you will need to install orml itself, before you do this
make sure you have a GPG key.
You can validate this with \f[C]$\ gpg\ \-\-list\-secret\-keys\f[] which
lists the secret keys available on the system, orml will use this to
populate ~/.orml/keys.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
$\ orml\ install\ D16BCBA7
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Before entering any commands validate that ~/.orml/keys has your default
key at the top.
When the \f[I]\-\-as\f[] option is omited orml will use this instead.
.SH COMMANDS
.SS version
.PP
Display the current version.
.SS help
.PP
Open the manual page if available and possible.
.SS drop [entry]
.PP
Drop the matching entry, hidden entry or directory.
This will prompt a confirmation which can optionally be skipped with
\f[I]\-\-force\f[].
.SS install [key]
.PP
Refer to the INSTALLING section above.
.SS list [\@hidden | [pattern | []]]
.PP
List entries optionally based on the provided argument.
.IP \[bu] 2
When no arguments are specified, all of the entries will be list
.IP \[bu] 2
When a single argument matching \f[I]\@hidden\f[] is specified, only
~/.orml/.hidden will be listed
.IP \[bu] 2
Any other arguments will be used to pattern match entries, and list
those exclusively
.SS move [from] [to]
.PP
Move the first entry to the second location.
When the second location exists, a prompt will appear which can be
skipped with \f[I]\-\-force\f[].
.SS insert [entry] [\- | input]
.PP
Insert and encrypt a new file, text message or secure/private key.
The key used to encrypt this entry is taken from ~/.orml/keys by
default, it will take the first line in the file.
This is also the way for you to set a preference on which key to use.
You can specify a key which will overwrite the preference with
\f[I]\-\-as [key]\f[].
There are multiple ways to provide insert with data, this is done by
changing the second argument.
.IP \[bu] 2
Omitting it, which will spawn a prompt.
This prompt will not visibly hide user input without the
\f[I]\-\-password\f[] option
.IP \[bu] 2
Supplying a single dash, telling orml to read from standard input
instead of using the arguments
.IP \[bu] 2
Specifying the \f[I]\-\-secret [length]\f[] option, this will use a
/dev/urandom string using the printable ascii character set and the
provided length
.IP \[bu] 2
Anything else which doesn\[aq]t apply to the previous clauses is
initially treated as a file path.
If this ends up not being a valid path, it is interpret as text.
.SS select [entry]
.PP
Select and decrypt a existing entry.
You don\[aq]t need to specify a key, gpg will identify if the required
key is available by itself.
It is possible to suppress any output to standard output with the
\f[I]\-\-null\f[] option.
Additionally you can use the \f[I]\-\-clipboard\f[] option to copy the
contents of entry to your clipboard.
.SS hide [entry]
.PP
Hide the matching entry.
the file is then moved to ~/.orml/hidden with the hash of the relative
path as its new filename.
You can still access this entry like you normally would with select.
.SS unhide [entry]
.PP
Unhide the matching hidden entry by replacing the hash with the provided
matching relative path, it will be interpret the same way it was set
initially.
.SS import [file]
.PP
Import a tarball or gpg file resembling a logical ordering structure.
All found directories are created or reused dependent on the existing
directories in ~/.orml.
All the new files found are added, the duplicate files will be
overwritten by their import.
When a gpg file is provided \f[B]without\f[] extension, you need to tell
provide the \f[I]\-\-decrypt\f[] option.
.SS export [file]
.PP
Export everything in ~/.orml by making a tarball writen to the provided
\&.
You can additionally encrypt it with the \f[I]\-\-encrypt\f[] option,
this can be used in combination with the \f[I]\-\-as [key]\f[].
.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-passphrase [passphrase]
.PP
Use this passphrase instead of the later prompted one (not very secure).
.SS \-\-secret [length]
.PP
Ignore any user received input and use a /dev/urandom string consisting
of all the printable ascii characters and the provided length.
.SS \-\-as [key]
.PP
Do not use the preferenced key from ~/.orml/keys.
Instead use the provided key, regardless of its existence in the
~/.orml/keys file.
This option only applies to \f[B]export\f[] when the
\f[I]\-\-encrypt\f[] option is also set.
.SS \-\-encrypt
.PP
After creating the tarball, encrypt it with either the preferenced key,
or the key provided by \f[I]\-\-as\f[].
.SS \-\-decrypt
.PP
Force decrypt the tarball before attempting to import it.
.SS \-\-clipboard
.PP
Copy the contents of the selected entry to the clipboard.
.SS \-\-null
